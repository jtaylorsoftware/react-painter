# React Painter

A minimal painting app where the canvas and painting is controlled using WebAssembly generated by `wasm-pack`.

## Building

Because the project depends on [`@wasm-tool/wasm-pack-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wasm-tool/wasm-pack-plugin) you will need to install Rust and `wasm-pack` to build or run `npm start`. Installation steps can be found [here](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/quickstart.html).

It's important to note that breaking changes to the generated `.wasm` ABI while running in development mode will potentially break the app until the page is manually refreshed (restarting dev mode shouldn't be necessary).

## Running

Use `npm run start` to run locally or `npm run build` in production.
